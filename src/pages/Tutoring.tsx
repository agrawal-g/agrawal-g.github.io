                <h1>Tutoring</h1>
                <p>I've tutored for over ten years, working with students from
                    middle-school through college, aiding with both coursework
                    and standardized test preparation. I now run a tutoring
                    agency, <b>Spacebound Tutoring, Inc.</b> which offers
                    tutoring services for students of all ages, tailored for
                    every students' needs, including, but not limited to,
                    the CPS HSAT, SSAT, SAT, ACT, CLEP, and LSAT exams.
                </p>
                <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
                <h3>Blending Traditional and Innovative Pedagogy</h3>
                <p>We combine time-tested teaching methods as well as
                    cutting-edge tools, in order to keep students engaged
                    without sacrificing results. Our tutors have used
                    tools like Minecraft to teach digital circuit design, and
                    online interactive graphing software to teach Algebra II
                    alongside old-fashioned handwritten flashcards and problem
                    sets.</p>
                <h3>Tutors who <i>Teach</i> well, not just <i>Test</i> well</h3>
                <p>Other tutoring companies hire college or graduate students
                    who aced their standardized tests, but too often, don’t
                    know how to help a student who is struggling. That’s why
                    we hire students with tutoring experience, who empathize with
                    the difficulty of subjects like math and science, and can help
                    guide students through the quagmire.</p>
                <h3>Teaching Beyond the Test</h3>
                <p>We believe that both a combination of test-taking
                    strategies and a solid understanding of the material is
                    necessary to succeed on assignments, exams, and standardized
                    tests, and our tutoring lesson plans reflect this. We want
                    students to understand not only what to do, but how, why, when,
                    where and what not to do as well.</p>
                <h3>Personalized Tutoring for Your Needs and Goals</h3>
                <p>While we believe every student is capable of getting a
                    perfect score on that test, we don’t think that’s realistic
                    or appropriate for every student. We understand that your
                    tutoring is just one facet of your life, and so we work to
                    help you achieve your goals within your resources.</p>
                <h3>Integrated Online Tutoring, Maximizing Convenience and Efficacy
                </h3>
                <p>Many parents dislike Zoom tutoring, which often entails a
                    tutor speaking at a student while drawing on the
                    whiteboard. We think tutoring needs to be a conversation
                    between a student and a tutor, and should use all available
                    tools at our disposable. That’s why we offer online
                    tutoring at whatever time slot is best for your needs,
                    using software that facilitates student involvement.</p>
